2. If you choose to continue, you can select one of the following books:
   - **All The Roads Lead To Rome** — A conspiracy theory from a fictional world.
   - **Scars** — A self-help book about loving yourself.
   - **Annabelle** — A horror story about a cursed doll.
3. After viewing a book description, you’ll be asked again whether you want to continue or exit.
